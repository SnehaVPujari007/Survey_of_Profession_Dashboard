## Project Overview
The Power BI project aims to visualize the results of a survey conducted among different professions across various countries. The goal is to provide insights into the distribution, trends, and key metrics of professions, highlighting differences and similarities across geographical regions.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from a survey. The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Country**: The country where the respondent is based.
- **Profession**: The profession of the respondent.
- **Age**: The age of the respondent.
- **Gender**: The gender of the respondent.
- **Years of Experience**: The number of years the respondent has been in their profession.
- **Salary**: The annual salary of the respondent.
- **Job Satisfaction**: A rating of job satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10.

... and many more.

## Data Preparation
### Data Cleaning:
- Remove any duplicates.
- Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., impute, remove).
- Standardize data formats (e.g., date formats, numeric values).

### Data Transformation:
- Create calculated columns as needed (e.g., Age Groups, Experience Levels).
- Normalize data to ensure consistency in analysis.

### Data Loading:
- Import the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard is designed to provide an interactive and intuitive user experience, enabling users to explore the survey data effectively.
